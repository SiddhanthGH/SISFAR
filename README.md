# SISFAR (Step-wise Integrator Solution For Atmospheric Reentry)

CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS EARTH ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY

The program takes in initial orbital parameters and simulates, step by step, the trajectory of the spacecraft with those initial parameters through Earth's atmosphere, presenting the data in a graph post calculation.

Purple = Downrange Distance on Earth from simulation start (m)

Blue = Height above mean sea level (m)

Red = Velocity (m/s)

Green = Acceleration (m/s^2)

X axis = time (s)
